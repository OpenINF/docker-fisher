## Development

Before cloning this repository, please ensure appropriate safety precautions are taken.
This means being sure to use an air-tight and ephemeral development environment to
essentially create a disposable sandbox. This may be accomplished using virtualization
software such as [Oracle VM VirtualBox][] for local development or perhaps consider using
cloud-based virtualization offerings.<br /><br />

</summary><br />

> Once installed, a virtual machine and its virtual hard disks can be considered
> a container that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied, backed up, and
> transported between hosts.
>
> Using virtual machines enables you to build and test a multi-node networked
> service, for example. Issues with networking, operating system, and software
> configuration can be investigated easily.
>
> In addition to that, with the use of an Oracle VM VirtualBox feature called
> snapshots, one can save a particular state of a virtual machine and revert
> back to that state, if necessary. This way, one can freely experiment with a
> computing environment. If something goes wrong, such as problems after
> installing software or infecting the guest with a virus, you can easily switch
> back to a previous snapshot and avoid the need of frequent backups and
> restores.
>
> Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel back and
> forward in virtual machine time. You can delete snapshots while a VM is
> running to reclaim disk space.

<!-- TODO(DerekNonGeneric):

We would be remiss to mention the air-tightness of a VM architecture without
mentioning that having a [watertight privacy architecture][] would likewise
be preferable. Whonix offers detailed VirtualBox import instructions.[^1]

Please note usage of Whonix implies use of the Tor network, which it uses
to provide the strongest protection of client IP addresses. However, this may
be contentious in some academic and workplace settings. Usage of Whonix was,
however, suggested to the original author of this document by his professor.
